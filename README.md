# Titanic Survival Prediction Model
## Introdduction / Case study 
I developed a machine learning model using the the famous Titanic dataset, which is used by many people all over the world. It provides information on the fate of passengers on the Titanic and summarized data on each of the passegers according to 
    economic status (class), 
    sex, 
    age 
    Fate (survival or not).

I initially used this project for the “Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster” Competition on Kaggle where we are asked to predict whether a passenger on the titanic would have been survived or not based on the original data set. The Model was later converted into a web application to be accessable to non- programers using the streamlit data science web framework.This project focuses on developing a machine learning model for predicting the survival outcomes of passengers aboard the Titanic. The model utilizes the famous Titanic dataset, which provides valuable information on passengers' fate based on various attributes such as economic status, sex, age, and survival.

## Dataset
The Titanic dataset has been widely used worldwide and gained popularity through its inclusion in numerous machine learning competitions and projects. It offers a comprehensive summary of the passengers' data, allowing for extensive analysis and prediction.

## Competition
Initially, this project was developed for the "Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster" competition hosted on Kaggle. The competition challenged participants to predict the survival or non-survival of passengers based on the original dataset. The model developed for this competition achieved promising results and served as the foundation for further enhancements.

## Web Application
To make the model accessible to non-programmers and provide an intuitive interface for predictions, it was converted into a web application. The Streamlit data science web framework was utilized to create a user-friendly and interactive application. This framework simplifies the development process and enables seamless integration with the model.

## Getting Started
To get started with the Titanic Survival Prediction Model, follow these steps:

## Clone the repository to your local machine.
Install the required dependencies mentioned in the requirements.txt file.
Run the web application using the Streamlit command: streamlit run app.py.
Access the application through your web browser to interact with the model and obtain predictions.

## Usage
Once the web application is running, you can input the necessary passenger information, such as economic status, sex, and age. The model will process the data and provide a prediction on the passenger's survival outcome. The intuitive interface and clear instructions within the web application make it easy for users to interact with the model.
