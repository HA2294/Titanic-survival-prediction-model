# Titanic-survival-prediction-model
I developed a machine learning model using the the famous Titanic dataset, which is used by many people all over the world. It provides information on the fate of passengers on the Titanic and summarized data on each of the passegers according to 
    economic status (class), 
    sex, 
    age 
    Fate (survival or not).

I initially used this project for the “Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster” Competition on Kaggle where we are asked to predict whether a passenger on the titanic would have been survived or not based on the original data set.
